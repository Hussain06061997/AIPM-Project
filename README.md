# Project Overview

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
Project Summary

In the current state of the world a lot of emphasis has been placed on convenience and comfort. For example, being able to do shopping just from sitting in your house is one of the best forms of convenience. The same thing goes for any company or body which needs to differentiate between male and female. Thus having a system which can differentiate a person’s gender just by using their image as the only input is truly remarkable. It will be more convenient and effective as the world is moving forward to becoming more ‘online’ heavy. Since a human can easily identify the gender of another human based on their image, it will be much more difficult for a machine to do the same. This is because machines lack the power of human intuition. In rare cases, it can still be difficult even for a human to determine the gender of another person if they can only rely on their image.

## D. EXECUTING THE PROJECT
#### Project Design and coding
<p> The first phase of our project involves preparing the dataset for training. We prepare our dataset by loading the images into a Jupyter Notebook file and resizing it using Python. The primary reason for resizing the images is to make easier and faster for the model to train on the image data, because the smaller the size of an image, the shorter the length of training. </p>

<p align="center">Figure 1: The code for data preparation in jupyter notebook</p>
<p>After we finished preparing the data, we stored the images into a .pickle file so that it can be used in a different notebook file that is dedicated to training the model.</p>

<p align="center">Figure 2: The code for storing the prepared dataset into a .pickle file</p>
<p> After we have finished preparing the data, we used the TensorFlow library to build a model for the image recognition module. Figure 1 below shows the code for building the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the Tensorflow Keras library.</p>

<p align="center">Figure 3: The code for building and training the model</p>
<p>The model is then saved into the working directory as a .model file. This .model file will then be used by another program to serve as a backend for our web application</p>

<p align="center">Figure 4: The code for saving the model into a .model file</p>
<p> Our project is mainly developed using Flask. Flask is a python web development framework. Since our model is written and trained in python. We used Flask as a backend to integrate the model with our web application. This will enable the user to interact with our model via a web application. Figure 1 below shows the python Flask program that serves as the backend for our web application.</p>

<p align="center">Figure 5: The Flask Program for the project</p>
<p>We also designed a website that serves as the frontend of our application. The website is written in HTML with the CSS Bootstrap Framework. And a few Flask functions are integrated into the HTML to allow for the website to update its content if it receives a response from the model</p>
