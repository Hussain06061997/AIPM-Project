# Project Overview

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
Project Summary

In the current state of the world a lot of emphasis has been placed on convenience and comfort. For example, being able to do shopping just from sitting in your house is one of the best forms of convenience. The same thing goes for any company or body which needs to differentiate between male and female. Thus having a system which can differentiate a person’s gender just by using their image as the only input is truly remarkable. It will be more convenient and effective as the world is moving forward to becoming more ‘online’ heavy. Since a human can easily identify the gender of another human based on their voice, it will be much more difficult for a machine to do the same. This is because machines lack the power of human intuition. In rare cases, it can still be difficult even for a human to determine the gender of another person if they can only rely on their image.
